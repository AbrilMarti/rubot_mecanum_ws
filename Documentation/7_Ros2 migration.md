## 1. **ROS2 Installation & Tools**
Follow the instructions on:
https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html

Some other installations needed:
- python3 pip
```shell
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install argcomplete
```
> needed for autoformating (press crtl+shift+i)
- Colcon compilation utility (https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial.html)
```shell
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```
> To use autocompletion you need to add in ~/.bashrc file this line:
>- source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
- Visual Studio Code with some extensions:
    - python 
    - python for VS Code
    - python Intellisense
    - XML (Red-Hat)
    - XML Tools
    - Code runner
    - ROS
    - C/C++
    - cmake

- Terminator (https://cheatography.com/svschannak/cheat-sheets/terminator-ubuntu/):
```shell
sudo apt install terminator
```
Finally you have to reboot:
```shell
sudo reboot
```

## 2. **Create workspace**

To work with ROS2 first open your ~/.bashrc and be sure you have sourced ROS2 adding the lines:
- source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
- source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash

Create "self_driving_car_ws2" workspace with "src" folder

Compile the ws:
```shell
colcon build
```
